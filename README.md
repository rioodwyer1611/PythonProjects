# PythonProjects
A storage space for simple python projects I have completed in my search to master Data Science.
Site Ran through a Jekyll implementation and Netlify.

## [Stock Grapher:](https://github.com/rioodwyer1611/PythonProjects/tree/e2a6c42257536f6eae0d85c8b20f1f196d7cbc6a/Stock_Grapher)
#### A really simple program which takes the current share values of two stocks (Tesla and Gamestop) and graphs their stock data and revenue output.
Created to learn how to use:
  - Pandas
  - BeautifulSoup
  - Requests
  - YFinance

Completed as part of an IBM Python Project for Data Science Course.


## [Optimal Coffee Shop Location Finder:](https://github.com/rioodwyer1611/PythonProjects/tree/e2a6c42257536f6eae0d85c8b20f1f196d7cbc6a/Optimal_Coffee_Shop_Location_Finder)
#### A more interesting application which displays all 81 libraries in Chicago, as given by a provided IBM resource, and creates a machine learning model which identifies the best places to open a certain amount of cafes, as to best fit in the surrounding area of the libraries.
Created to learn:
  - Requests
  - Folium
  - GeoPy
  - Webbrowser
  - OS
  - DocPlex & CPlex (Not used in final model but available to view in code)
  - OrTools

Completed as a part of an IBM What is Data Science? Course.

## [Data Cleaning:](https://github.com/rioodwyer1611/PythonProjects/tree/e2a6c42257536f6eae0d85c8b20f1f196d7cbc6a/Optimal_Coffee_Shop_Location_Finder)
#### A pretty interesting data cleaning operation taken from the IBM Tools for Data Science Course. Useful for learning the basics of said operations. I did not build this, this is just a storage space for the code model after finishing the course. I did work to change the code in a couple ways for it to work with my machine outside of the IBM notebook environment.
Created to learn:
  - Pandas
